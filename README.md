# CashDrawer

*A DLL for opening a POS cash drawer*

This is a little DLL that I developed for opening a POS cash drawer. 
In POS settings usually the cash drawer is connected through the ticket printer. 
This DLL opens the printer port and sends the commands needed to forward an 
external hardware signal.
